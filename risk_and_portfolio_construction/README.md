# A university assignment of the Statistics Honours: Portfolio Theory module.

This was completed as a requirement for grading in 2016. I am in the process of sourcing the project description for understanding and to obtain the questions that were answered as part of the project.

If I remember correctly, the assignment involved taking historical data for 20 shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and splitting them into two portfolios of ten shares at random.

It involved calculating the reliability of beta for each portfolio, comparing the portfolios to ALSI and finding their position with respect to the efficient frontier.
