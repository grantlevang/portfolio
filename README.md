This folder contains pieces of some works I have done

This folder aims to demonstrate the range of projects and tasks I have worked on. Some examples are simple and others are more in-depth. 

I have tried to name the folders of each project or task as descriptively as possible. 

There is a selection of Python applications, Jupyter Notebooks, Excel Worksheets and R scripts. Each folder has its own README to provide context and to assist with set-up and viewing.
