# An analysis of the variables that contribute to points earned on a dataset of wines

This is a data analysis based in a Jupyter notebook with a Python engine. 

The data is available in **wine.csv**.

The notebook (available as **wine.ipynb**) contains an analysis of relationships between variables inluding visualizations and scores, and identifies the most significant variables contributing to wine points.

The end of the notebook was an activity experimenting with wordcloud.

Viewing the notebook requires Jupyter, available here: https://jupyter.org/.

Running the notebook requires Python 3 or later. The following packages will also need to be installed in the site-packages library (if not already there):
- wordcloud
- seaborn
- numpy
- pandas
