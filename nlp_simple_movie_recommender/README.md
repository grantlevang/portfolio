# Movie Recommender

This is a simple Python application that uses a basic `NLP` function to recommend a movie from a defined list of movies. The engine uses the blurb descriptions of movies to identify similar movies and return the movie with the greatest similarity score.
The blurb description is the description of a movie that you would find on the back of a dvd box.

It requires one user input which is the blurb description of a movie. A sample blurb description is available in **blurb_sample.txt**. Paste this into the console when prompted.

The list of movies is available in **movies.txt**. It is a short list but it can be added to. Please be aware of the format in this file if you would like to make additions.
