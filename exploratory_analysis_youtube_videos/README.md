This is a data analysis based in a Jupyter notebook with a Python engine. 

The data is available in `youtube.txt`.

The notebook (available as `exploratory_analysis_youtube_videos.ipynb`) contains an analysis of relationships between variables inluding visualizations and scores, and identifies the most significant variables contributing to views.

Viewing the notebook requires Jupyter, available here: https://jupyter.org/.
